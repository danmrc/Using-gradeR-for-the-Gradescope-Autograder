Please complete the following problems.

Remember:
\begin{itemize}
\item do not rename external files or edit them in any way.
\item do not use global paths in your script. Instead, use \verb|setwd()| interactively in the console, but do not include this code in your submission.
\item do not destroy or overwrite any variables in your program.
\end{itemize}

It might help to clear all the objects from your workspace, and then \verb|source| your file before you submit it. This will often uncover bugs.
